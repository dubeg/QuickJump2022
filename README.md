# README
A Visual Studio 2022 extension to mimick Sublime Text's command palette.

[QuickJump](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChristianSchubert.QuickJump) was initially an extension made by Christian Schubert, but it hasn't been updated since 2019. It seems that he disappeared from the online world.
So I decompiled & recompiled it to support Visual Studio 2022.

I'm adding a few niceties to it.

## Commands
- `QuickJump.ShowMethodSearchForm`: search symbols in the active document.
- `QuickJump.ShowFileSearchForm`: search files in the active solution.
- `QuickJump.ShowCommandSearchForm`: search all commands (with canonical name only).
- `QuickJump.ShowKnownCommandSearchForm`: search known commands (with friendly name & icon).

## Credits
I should probably add a credits section here, since I used code from all over...
